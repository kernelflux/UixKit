 * [SmartItemDecoration] is an extensible base class for [RecyclerView.ItemDecoration].

 * custom drawing behaviors and spacing between items.

 * Subclasses should override the following methods to achieve custom effects:
 * - [onDraw]: Called before an item is drawn (e.g., to draw background decorations).
 * - [onDrawOver]: Called after an item is drawn (e.g., to draw foreground overlays).
 * - [getItemOffsets]: Used to set margins for each item.
